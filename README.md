THE GAME PLAN: make a game in unity... 

make a better version of that game maker one... (modularize so all that is needed is a map with pre-made markers for location of things)
	maybe make it instead of individual puzzles, have like a series of dungeons where people can die (never to be seen again) and you can get new people by doing extra things (like undo a trap or kill a monster that normally you wouldn't have to)
	also have something like in between each "dungeon" where you can heal, upgrade, etc.
	allows for procedural generation of levels and basically a lot of luck :D
	have first 3-5 levels consistent just so people can learn the game and setup a decent team
	different types of characters (and monsters), each with simple stats (important ones = hp, att, def, spd, stamina)
		hp = how much damage can be taken (can be upgraded and restored)
		att = how much base damage is dealt (can be upgraded)
		def = takes [att base - def] damage (can be upgraded)
		spd = how often attacks happen (can be upgraded)
		stamina = how many things can be done in each level (can be upgraded and restored and recovers ½ to ¾ at end of dungeon)


some procedurally generated game.... either of levels or with a never ending thing
	maybe reverse tower defense (AI will place more and more (destroyable) towers as time goes on but the player is limited to a certain amount of time before failing)  
	or even monster fighting generation one (only pre-set moves so simple AI, or just have simple commands like punch, dodge, counter, kick, jump) with stats
